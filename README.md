🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🚀

I've just completed a fun and challenging coding project—a Countdown Timer! ⏳✨

Key Features:
User Input Validation: Ensures users enter valid dates and times.
Live Countdown: Displays days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until the target date.
Responsive Design: Looks great on any device, thanks to CSS flexbox.
Dynamic Updates: Real-time countdown using JavaScript's setInterval.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Structuring the content.
CSS: Styling the timer and making it responsive.
JavaScript: Implementing the core functionality of the countdown.
Why This Project?
I wanted to create something practical and visually appealing while honing my skills in front-end development. This project allowed me to dive deeper into JavaScript's Date API and practice responsive design techniques.

Feel free to check out the project and let me know what you think! 😊
